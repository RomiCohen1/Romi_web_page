# My Project

Welcome to my project! This is a brief overview of what this project is about.


## Q1: filenames
Filenames: index.html, cv.css, nav.css, no-transition-on-resize.js, logic.js


## Q2: jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies things in HTML, such as:  DOM tree traversal, manipulation, event handling, and CSS animation.

## Q3: JS
I wrote 2 functions in JS. The first is to change to dark/light mode. I used DOM tree traversal to change the name of a div class and by that, I managed to change the background colors of the website. 
The second function creates a live gallery, that changes images by itself. I used DOM tree traversal to change the CSS properties of the images (to show the image or to hide it). 

## Q4: Forms
If I added a server-side functionality to the form, it would involve processing the form data on the server side after it is submitted.
When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the form data will be submitted to the server and the server will validate the data and process it (storing it in a database, sending email notifications, etc.). After that, the server would send a response back to the client (confirmation or error).
